### 1. Elevator Problem

A man works on the 10-th floor and takes the elevator down to ground level at the end of the day. Yet every morning, he only takes the elevator to the 7th floor, even when in a hurry.
But he goes all the way to the 10-th floor when others are in the elevator with him or it is a rainy day. Why?

**Solution:**
He is too short to reach the “10” button . But when others are with him, he can ask them to push the button for 10th floor. On a rainy day, he has an umbrella, so he can press the button using that.
